1.  The value of 'i' will be printed to the console because of the console.log() method. 'i' equals the number of elements in the price array. It can be printed outside the for-loop because 'i' is defined as a function variable through the use of the 'var' keyword.
2.  The final value of 'discountedPrice' will be printed, just before the for-loop ends, to the console because of the console.log() method. 'discountedPrice' equals the last element in the price array times what the price of the time will be to the exact decimal point. It can be printed outside the for-loop because 'discountedPrice' is defined as a function variable through the use of the 'var' keyword.
3.  The final value of 'finalPrice' will be printed, just before the for-loop ends, to the console because of the console.log() method. 'finalPrice' equals the rounded value of the 'discountedPrice'. It can be printed outside the for-loop because 'finalPrice' is defined as a function variable through the use of the 'var' keyword.
4.  What will be returned is an array with the following elements [50, 100, 150]. The first element is multiplied by .5 and then rounded (which in this case doesn't do anything really) to be 50 and pushed to the back of the array. Same is done to the second and third elements. So basically, the function with these parameters returns an array whose elements are divided by 2 from the array in the parameter.
5.  The console will display an error at this line because the variable 'i' is created using 'let' in the for-loop, meaning it only exists in the for-loop.
6.  The console will display an error at this line because the variable 'discountedPrice' is created using 'let' in the for-loop, meaning it only exists in the for-loop.
7.  The final value of 'finalPrice' will be printed, just before the for-loop ends, to the console because of the console.log() method. 'finalPrice' equals the rounded value of the 'discountedPrice'. It can be printed outside the for-loop because 'finalPrice' is defined outside the for loop, so it's a 'function variable'.
8.  Since discounted is declared outside the for loop, the same will happen if discounted was created using the 'var' keyword. What will be returned is an array with the following elements [50, 100, 150]. The first element is multiplied by .5 and then rounded (which in this case doesn't do anything really) to be 50 and pushed to the back of the array. Same is done to the second and third elements. So basically, the function with these parameters returns an array whose elements are divided by 2 from the array in the parameter. 
9.  The console will display an error at this line because the variable 'i' is created using 'let' in the for-loop, meaning it only exists in the for-loop.
10. The console will display an error at this line because the variable 'discountedPrice' is created using 'const' in the for-loop, and since 'const' behaves similarly to 'let', 'discountedPrice' only exists in the for-loop.
11. A zero will be printed to the console because the initial value of 'finalPrice' can not be changed because of 'const'.
12. An empty array will be printed to the console because the initial value of 'discounted' can not be changed because of 'const'.
